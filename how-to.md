# How to create your own

## Project overview

This is how to create an automatic waterer for a plant. It consists of 4 differnet sensors and uses a Raspberry Pi 4 to run all the code. 

## Introduction

This final project was created by Maria Boza(mib57) & Ashley Heckman(agh93) for ECE 5725 final project. The project has been our own implementation of a planter that is a bit more electronic. We started with the brains which is the Raspberry Pi 4 that has been used all semester to work on our labs. It has 4 different sensors, moister, humidity, temperature, and light. Python was used to code all the sensor readings as what is being displayed. This project is greared towards new plant owners who don't know much about plants and would like the help. Another way our product can be used is to monitor plants when a human is not able to water it.
