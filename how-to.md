# How to create your own

## Project overview

This is how to create an automatic waterer for a plant. It consists of 4 differnet sensors and uses a Raspberry Pi 4 to run all the code. 

## Introduction

This final project was created by Maria Boza(mib57) & Ashley Heckman(agh93) for ECE 5725 Spring 2023. The project has been our own implementation of a planter that is a bit more electronic. We started with the brains which is the Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi) that has been used all semester to work on our labs. It has 4 different sensors, moister, humidity, temperature, and light. Python was used to code all the sensor readings as what is being displayed. This project is greared towards new plant owners who don't know much about plants and would like the help. Another way our product can be used is to monitor plants when a human is not able to water it. 

## Design and testing 

### Design 

For the design of this project we decided to make a product that will help plant growers have the ability to leave their plant un attended and have it get wattered. It also helps new planters understand how to water their new plant. The start of the design was to work with the RPi and use it to create an embedded system. We decided to create an automatic plant waterer. As we started the project we first planted the seeds in a 3D printed planter. This was the best way to do it becuase it means that we are able to create one that fits exactly with our pump and fits the tubing. As for the sensors we used 4 different ones. Moisture sensor, the basic sensor to our product. This sensor is used to meansure the moisture of the soil to determine when to water the plant.
